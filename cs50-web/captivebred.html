                  <p id="post-text">The idea that seahorses cannot be kept in a home aquarium is outdated.
                  A decade ago, people struggled to keep seahorses in public aquariums, with little hope of ever seeing them in a home aquarium.
                  But today, hobbyists all around the world are successfully keeping seahroses, even proving that seahorses can live even longer lives in an aquarium.
                  Many of our members' seahorses live up to eight years, which is much longer than the year that scientists believed they could survive.
                  The main reason for this is knowledge gained through experience. Our care guides aim to share this knowledge and experience to help even the
                  newest seahorse keeper succeed!  This guide will cover the main things to consider when choosing which seahorse to keep.</p>

                    <p id="post-text">
                      The most important key to success with seahorses is starting out with a healthy seahorse.  The idea that seahorses were too difficult to
                      keep in a home aquarium stemmed from stores selling wild-caught or net-pen (maricultured) raised seahorses.  Wild caught or net-pen seahorses (any species)
                      often need to be treated in a quarantine tank for many weeks to be sure they do not have any illness or disease that came from living in ocean water.
                      The stress of being captured and shipped leads to even more possible illnesses in these seahorses.  They often have not been weaned onto frozen
                      foods, which means a keeper would need a supply of live feeds.  They are often not treated well by collectors and will arrive starving and stressed out.
                      Not a good start for anyone new to seahorse keeping!</p>
                    <p id="post-text">
                      Captive bred seahorses are raised in a clean, sterile environment.  They are raised in an aquarium from birth, and weaned on to frozen foods at
                      an early age.  They are used to seeing humans and used to living in an aquarium, which means your aquarium will not stress them out!

                    <p id="post-text">
                      The species available in your area might limit which species you can purchase. Due to CITES regulations,
                      shipping seahorses internationally is very difficult.  Will share some differences between the species, but check with your local reef club, in our
                      facebook group, or a seahorse breeder in your area to determine which species have been captive bred and are available.

                    Common Seahorses

                    <p id="post-text">
                      In the United States, the most commonly available captive bred seahorse species is H. erectus. Luckily, they are considered one of the
                      easiest seahorses to keep.  H. erectus are hardy, friendly and do very well in a home aquarium. Others species available
                      include: H. reidi, H. kuda, H. comes, H. abdominalis, H. zosterae.
                      H. erectus, H. reidi, H. comes and H. kuda have similar <a href="./care.html">care requirements</a> and are all also hardy species that do
                      well in the home aquarium given proper conditions. These four species reach approximately 6-8+ inches with maturity.
                      But we recommend that someone new to seahorse keeping start with H. erectus, as they are the most friendly. They also breed quickly and their fry
                      are benthic (meaning they hitch from birth and are easier to raise).  So
                      if you are interested in breeding and raising seahorse fry, H. erectus is the species for you!

                      Dwarf seahorses (H. zosterae) are much smaller seahorses that have different requirements.   Their maximum adult size is 1-1.5 inches.
                      The bonus to keeping this species is that they
                      are so small, that many can be kept in a much smaller aquarium.  An entire herd can be kept in a 10 gallon aquarium, versus the larger species that
                      need a 30 gallon aquarium per pair minimum.  However, a dwarf seahorse is very similar to a seahorse fry.  They require live foods, so a hobbyist must
                      be ready to hatch artemia for them on a daily basis.  They also cannot have any other tank mates, as many would eat them because they are so small.  Watch

                      H. abdominalis is a cold-water species, which means their needs are different from the common species also. They are one of the largest
                      species of seahorse, growing to 10-12 inches at maturity.  A hobbyist would need to keep this large size in mind when choosing an aquarium.  H. abdominalis
                      will require at least a 100 gallon tank, and even bigger would be better.  They also require a temperature of 65-67 F, very
                      different from the 68-74 F for the other common species.  This makes it very difficult to keep any tank mates or coral in their tank, as most other
                      fish and coral prefer a much warmer aquarium.  A hobbyist must be ready to buy a chiller in order to keep H. abdominalis, and make it a species only
                      tank. H. abdominalis is one of the prettiest species of seahorse, that can be raised easily if they are provided the right conditions.  Just be sure to
                      research their needs before deciding on this species.

                      Most seahorses are sold at 4-6 months old and are not full grown.  A keeper must plan ahead and buy a tank big enough to accomodate the 6-8+ inch adults that
                      their seahorses will grow to very quickly.  The recommendation is 30 gallons per pair of seahorses.  However, bigger is always better.  Seahorses are very
                      messy eaters, that eat more than the average fish and therefore produce more waste. Overstocking seahorses leads to a build up of organics, which often leads
                      to sick seahorses.  Try to plan ahead and ensure that your aquarium is big enough to handle the seahorse bioload.

                      Many aquarists ask if they can put seahorses in their reef tank or sump.  Unfortunately, seahorses need a much lower temperature than other fish and coral
                      prefer.  They also cannot be kept with any coral that stings or aggressive fish.  Read more about this in our <a href="./care.html">Setting up for Success

                      Many new keepers will be tempted to mix different species together in one aquarium.  Unfortunately, that rarely works out.  Seahorses from
                      different parts of the world will have immunity to the different bacteria and parasites in the area from which they came.  If you add two species that
                      come from different areas, they will not have immunity to the same pathogens.  Breeders raise seahorses in species only tanks, so even captive bred
                      species from the same breeder should not be mixed. Seahorses have a primitive immune system and are more susceptible to bacterial related issues than
                      to other fish, so they really should be kept in a species only tank with very limited tank mates of any kind.

                    <p id="post-text">
                      The one exception to this rule is keeping H. erectus and H. reidi in the same aquarium.  They come from areas that are very close to one another and
                      actually interbreed in the wild. Hobbyists have had the most luck mixing these two species, and a the species "H. erectus- H. reidi Hybrids" can
                      now be purchased from many US breeders.

                    Seahorses will change color to blend in to their environment.  Never buy a seahorse based on color, as it will likely change.  A blue background on a tank
                    tends to encourage seahorses to turn yellow.  A lot of grey colored rock will cause seahorses to turn a silver color.  And red or black items in the
                    aquarium will cause seahorses to turn black.  A "Seahorse Color" article is coming soon, but in the meantime....always choose to buy healthy, captive bred
                    seahorses that are incredible no matter their color!<br>
