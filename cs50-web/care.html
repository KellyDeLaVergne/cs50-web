                      Seahorses are magical fish that bring to mind mythical images of a sea monster and mermaid stallion all wrapped
                      up in a little package with a horse shaped head.  They contradict all of the typical characteristics of a fish, with males giving birth
                      to offspring and bony plates covering their body instead of scales.
                      Their courting and reproduction behaviors have fascinated scientists, and people are always amazed at the sight of their graceful movements
                      and synchronized, spinning dance towards the surface that aligns them perfectly for an egg exchange.  Saltwater aquarium hobbyists are constantly
                      looking for exotic and unique fish to keep, so it's no surprise that seahorses have become so popular.  Keeping seahorses is not much harder than
                      keeping any other saltwater tank, but there are some differences.

                    <h4>Tank Size</h4>
                      <p id="post-text">
                        The first step to a successful seahorse tank is to purchase a big enough aquarium!  The minimum tank size recommendation for a common pair of seahorses is 30 gallons.  Each additional pair will require
                        another 30 gallons.  This recommendation is based on seahorse eating habits
                        (see <a href="#feeding">Feeding section</a> for more information about how this affects the tank) and the growth rate of common species (they grow much larger after being
                        purchased - up to 6-8+ inches in most species).
                        Most seahorse keepers will also want more seahorses after they fall in love with their first pair. In addition, seahorses breed like rabbits, so if you're at all
                        interested in allowing your pair to create more little seahorses, you're going to need more tank space and water volume.  The bottom line is that you certainly can
                        set up a 30 gallon tank for 2 seahorses, but you won't be able to put much else in the tank.
                        The more water you have, the more you can put in the tank with fewer long-term problems.  So go big!  One way to create more water volumne within a limited space is to add a sump underneath the
                        tank.  A better description of a sump is provided in the <a href="#sump">Sump Info</a> section.  We personally recommend setting up a 60+ gallon tank with a large sump to help.
                      </p>

                        The one thing that seahorses require is items to hitch upon.  Seahorses all have a prehensile tail that they use to grasp and hold on to items
                        within the tank.  The idea that seahorses need a low flow situation is outdated (see <a href="#flow">FLOW</a> section for more
                        info).  But, they DO need something to wrap their tail around (hitch to) in order to feel secure.  Depending on how you prefer your seahorse tank to
                        look, hitching options could include artificial decorations like fake plants and plastic chains, live items that don't sting like gorgonians or macroalgae, or even
                        branching rock for a more
                        natural look.

                        Filtration in a seahorse tank is very important!  We discussed why more water volume and a bigger tank can help, but setting up proper filtration is
                        essentially important!  Filtration is split into three types:  mechanical, biological and chemical.  Each has a seperate purpose that is important to a successful
                        seahorse tank.  All three types are recommended, but biological and mechanical are essential.  Biological media are what the good nitrifying bacteria
                        that is needed for the nitrogen cycle grow upon (the nitrogen cycle is explained further
                        in the <a href="#cycle">Proper Cycle</a> section).  Mechanical filtration removes larger particles,
                        so the biological filtration does not have to break down as much (example:  if a piece of food is captured and removed via mechanical filtration, the
                        biological media no longer needs to break down and remove it).  Chemical filtration removes dissoved particulates and includes any carbons, resins or
                        any other adsorbents used to remove impurities in the water.  This filtration method is typically only used in specific situations to alleviate an issue such as
                        high phosphates or nitrates.
                        Equally important to understand, we'll now talk about examples of each:

                              Rock - live rock would already have nitrifying bacteria living upon it, but you take the chance of it bringing other
                              things that would not be welcome. Dry rock - technically rock that you buy "dry" and must cycle to grow or add beneficial bacteria.
                              Cured rock - includes keeping rock in a bucket
                              with high flow and no lighting, doing constant water changes to ensure anything bad is removed while beneficial bacteria remains.

                              Floss or Sock - Floss could be added to a HOB filter, whereas a sock would be placed in the sump.  The job of each is to stop any larger pieces
                              of waste from re-entering the tank.  Any of these items need to be changed regularly.

                            <li>
                              Skimmer - People used to associate a skimmer with Gas Bubble Disease, but experience has shown that they are not related.  A skimmer is an
                              ESSENTIAL part of a seahorse tank's filtration.  Not only does a skimmer oxygenate the tank, but it also removes things we never see.  We recommend
                              buying a skimmer that is rated 2 times your tank size (for instance, a 30g aquarium would want a skimmer rated for 60g).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              UV sterilizer - A UV sterilizer uses ultraviolet lighting to kill algae and bacteria spores in the aquarium.  Most of the effective UVs are large, and can
                              only be used in a sump situation.  The strength of the light and the length of time that water
                              is exposed to the light determine how effective this method will work.  Research the flow rate through the UV sterilizer to maximize effectiveness!  This is
                              not a required method of mechanical filtration, but it can be very effective in limiting nuisance algae growth and even limit bad bacteria that might
                              bother your seahorses!  Be sure to place the UV after all other mechanical filtration in the sump, so that all large particles are already removed.

                              Carbon - This media typically comes in ready made bags that you can throw into a sump or filter.  Activated carbon removes elements like copper,
                              chlorine, dissolved proteins, antibiotics and discolorants.  However, this media can only "soak up" so much, so this type of filter media must
                              be replaced often (based on manufacturer guidelines).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Purigen - a synthetic adsorbent that removes soluble and insoluble impurities from the water.  It removes ammonia, nitrites and nitrates
                              from the water by removing the nitogenous organic waste that result in each compound.  Purigen also raises redox and makes the aquarium
                              water much clearer.  It needs to be replaced when the media turns brown (showing that it has "soaked up" so much waste).

                              will work, as long as you stick to one pair of seahorses and the tank mate guidelines.  New technology has provided HOB (hang on back) filters, skimmers and
                              even refugiums that can help with maintenance.  This set up will require more frequent water changes, (approx 20g per week), but provides an easy starting point
                              for a minimilistic seahorse tank.

                    <p id="post-text">An aquarium must be cycled properly before any seahorses or other fish are added.  Ammonia and nitrites that come from
                      seahorse waste, uneaten food and other decomposition within the tank must be converted to less toxic nitrates because they are very harmful to seahorses.
                      This is accomplished via the nitrogen cycle.  The image above shows this process within the ocean.  Unfortunately, we have less room in an aquarium, and we have
                      to make sure the water contains this good (nitrifying) bacteria (and optional plants).  If you're confused, don't worry, we will explain in simple terms below!  Unfortunately, many hobbyists do not understand the nitrogen
                      cycle and think that letting a tank filled with water sit for 4-6 weeks is all it takes.  Worse yet, some people will put seahorses in a brand new tank
                      with no waiting period, because they were not told they needed to cycle the tank.  These methods will not end well for a new seahorse keeper.

                      The "nitrogen cycle" includes the conversion of ammonia (NH3, very toxic) into nitrite (NO2, which is also toxic), via nitrifying bacteria called
                      nitrosonomas, and then the conversion of nitrites into nitrates (NO3, much less toxic and removed via filtration and/or water changes) via nitrifying bacteria called
                      blah blah.  The ammonia and nitrite are harmful to seahorses and other fish, so we need to be sure that the tank is "cycled" before adding them. "A cycled aquarium" indicates that the
                      tank's biological filter contains enough of both nitrifying bacteria to convert any ammonia into nitrate without reaching toxic levels that would harm
                      the seahorses.  The "biological filter" is explained a bit more in the <a href="#">biological filter</a> section, but can include rock, media in a sump and
                      any other porous surface in the aquarium that bacteria can inhabit.  Macroalgae is another form of biological filtration when kept in the tank, in the sump,
                      or on an algae scrubber.  There are many ways to properly cycle an aquarium, and the time it will take depends
                      on the method used.  We prefer the "ammonia cycle".  If you prefer to learn via video, Dan from Seahorse Source covered this topic very well in our Wine

                        "The Ammonia Cycle" includes adding ammonia to the tank to cycle the tank, ensuring that the tank can cycle through 1ppm of ammonia in 24 hours. This method
                         ensures that that the tank can handle seahorses and their messy eating habits and organic bioload!

                         The steps and explanation for using the ammonia cycle on an aquarium with dry rock or new media are listed here:
                        <ol>
                          <li>Check parameters to begin with:  test PH (8-8.3), salinity (1.020 and 1.025), temperature (low 80s because bacteria grow faster at higher temps),
                          and ammonia/nitrite levels (should be 0)</li>
                          <li>Add 1ml of ammonia to the tank slowly, testing every 20 minutes until the ammonia test indicates 1ppm of ammonia in the tank.  Keep track of
                          the ammont of ammonia you needed to add to reach 1ppm.</li>
                          <li>After reaching 1ppm ammonia, continue to test daily until the ammonia test reads zero.  Once ammonia is zero, test for nitrites.  The bacteria
                          that convert nitrite into nitrate take longer to grow, so don't add any more ammonia until nitrite test reads zero also</li>
                          <li>When nitrite test reads zero, add the amount of ammonia to equal 1ppm (that you kept track of in step 2)</li>
                          <li>Continue this process until you can add 1ppm ammonia to the tank, and get 0ppm readings of ammonia AND nitrites 24 hours later.  The tank is cycled
                          for seahorses when this is accomplished.</li>
                          <li>Remember that if it takes a few weeks to get your seahorses, you must keep adding ammonia to feed the good bacteria and keep it healthy.  We recommend adding 1ppm of
                          ammonia the day before you add seahorses, to ensure that the tank still has the proper ammount of nitrifying bacteria.</li>
                        </ol>

                    <p id="post-text">
                        It's seriously that simple to cycle a tank with ammonia, but so very important.  Other options to speed up the ammonia cycle (that will add more of the nitrifying bacteria that you are trying to grow in the tank) include:
                        <ol>
                          <li>
                            Adding media from an existing tank.  If you already have another seahorse or reef tank, you can take media from that tank (or it's sump) to help
                            "seed" your new tank.  There are some dangers in using this "speed up" method, as any pathogens in the first tank will transfer to the second.  Either
                            way, moving media from one tank to another will mean that the tank gains beneficial bacteria.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Adding pre-cycled media.  Very easily, you can keep any type of media (dry rock, brightwell bricks, or any other porous media) in a bucket.
                            The bucket needs a power head or some other flow to keep the oxygen moving through the media (bacteria need oxygen to survive), and the addition
                            of ammonia to "feed" the bacteria.  Keeping pre-cycled media isn't necessary for the average hobbyist, but if you intend to breed or set up
                            new tanks constantly, pre-cycled media can be very helpful.
                          </li>
                          <li>Adding bottled beneficial bacteria.  This adds more of the good, nitrifying bacteria that you need.  However, you must pay attention to the type of bottled
                        bacteria that you're buying and the expiration date on the bottle.  We recommend <a href="https://fritzaquatics.com/products/fritzzyme-7-freshwater">FritZyme

                        Once a seahorse tank is cycled, the ammonia and nitrite readings should never be < 25ppm.  Continue to test on a weekly basis, and any
                        time that seahorses act abnormally.  If you're ever in an emergency situation with high ammonia or nitrite levels, either do a water change to lower

                        Temperature in a seahorse tank is pretty important, because bacteria grows at a slower rate in
                        lower temps.  Seahorses' immune systems are different than other fish, and they are prone to bacterial infections.
                        By keeping the temperature low, seahorses are less likely to have bacterial issues.  Unfortunately, this makes it difficult to add other
                        coral or fish in with the seahorses, because they prefer higher temps.  The ideal temperature for a seahorse tank is below than 74F.  Equally important is making sure the temperature in the tank
                        doesn't fluctuate.  If you keep your home at a steady temp year-round, and the tank temp stays below 74F, you're
                        in good shape!  But if you live in a colder climate, you might need a heater.  In a warm climate, you might need a chiller.  A controller can
                        help you maintain a temp and correct the problem if temp falls too low or rises too high.

                        Seahorse articles and posts from 10 years ago told us that seahorses needed a "low flow environment".  But,
                        we've learned that they actually enjoy a higher rate of flow.  My own personal experience told me all that I needed to know!  I set up my first seahorse
                        tank with no powerheads or wavemakers, relying on the HOB filter to provide surface agitation.  My seahorses didn't move around much.  They seemed....bored.  When
                        nuisance algae began to cover my tank, I was advised to add more flow.  After adding a simple powerhead, my seahorses became so much more active!  They were literally
                        dancing in the flow!  Years later, I would never set up a seahorse tank without a lot of flow (leaving low flow spots via aquascape for any seahorses who want to 'chill').
                      </p>
                      <p id="post-text">A seahorse tank should have flow that will remove detritus from all areas of the tank,
                        but also provide areas of low flow for "resting".  This can be accomplished by using two wavemakers or powerheads, positioned at the bottom and middle
                        of the aquarium on opposite sides, with a strong pump in the sump providing surface agitation.  All powerheads or wavemakers must be covered to ensure that seahorse's don't
                        hitch on them and get their tails hurt, but seahorses will be much less active without adequate flow.  The recommendation today is 15-20+ turnover
                         rate.  We also recommend achieving this goal via multiple methods, such as a 30g tank with a 300 gph pump and (2) 150 gph wave makers.
                         This would provide 20 times turnover.  After you've added seahorses to the tank, watch to be sure that they can still swim freely, but don't be concerned if
                         you notice "playing in the flow" (seahorses will often hitch onto a covered wave maker and get pushed across the tank, only to swim back to the same
                         wavemaker.  They LIKE playing in the flow).  Only lower the flow rate if seahorses are not moving around because the flow rate is too high.

                        Tank mates for seahorses is a highly debated topic.  Many people argue about many species of coral and fish that they believe compliment a seahorse tank.
                        The rule of thumb is to never mix any fish that is aggressive or fast eating, nor any coral that might sting or let off toxins.  The reason for limiting fish tank mates
                        revolves around seahorse eating habits.  Some species of seahorses take food more readily than others, but all species are slow eaters.  They like to look over a piece
                        of food and ... well ... pretend that they're capturing prey via their camoflauge and skillful attack.  Aggressive fish will obviously bully a slow moving seahorse,
                        but even aggressive eaters will cause problems.  A calm clownfish for example might seem fine with seahorses, but they will eat all of the food before seahorses even
                        come close to it.  Clownfish also become more aggressive later in life, as they turn into a breeders (If you insist on keeping a clownfish with a seahorse, please
                        limit the number of clowns to 1).

                        Coral in a seahorse tank is less likely to cause problems, because the rules are pretty clear:
                        <ol>
                          <li>
                            SPS coral - don't do well in a seahorse tank.  Seahorses will hitch upon anything and everything that their tail happens to find.  So I wouldn't put an expensive
                            sps coral near a seahorse!  The seahorse will hitch for quite a while in some instances, damaging polyps and blocking them from light.  Sps also prefer a much
                            higher temperature and cleaner tank than seahorses.  It's just not a good plan.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            LPS coral - must be researched!  Anything that can sting (even late night stingers like torches) won't work in a seahorse tank.  Seahorses have "skin" versus scales and
                            when they get stung, it's much more likely to turn into an infection.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Soft coral - most softies work well in a seahorse tank.  In fact, softies like the dirty tank that seahorses provide, along with being able to handle the lower temperatures.
                            While you should research the particular soft coral you want add to your seahorse tank, to be sure they are not known for toxins (like palys), they will usually be a nice fit.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Recommendations - Gorgonians are beautiful, flowy and work well in a seahorse tank.  Soft corals like leathers, mushrooms, xenia and others that are less likely to release
                            toxins are welcome in a seahorse tank!  Gobies, dragonets, snails and many other slow moving, slow eating fish can be great tank mates!  If you want to keep your seahorses safe, provide them with a tank dedicated to them.  It's pretty simple to set up a seahorse only
                            tank, but for those that want more, we'll provide a tank mate list soon!

                        Seahorses in the wild eat live food continuously.  They need constant nourishment to stay healthy.  Captive bred seahorses are trained to eat frozen
                        foods, but they do not have the gut associated
                        lymphoid tissue in their digestive tract that other fish have to protect them from bacteria on decaying food. Seahorses are particularly susceptible
                        to bacteria like Vibrio and Mycobacterium that grow quickly on decaying organic matter.  Any food that is bad when purchased or left at the bottom of the tank
                        for longer than 10 minutes will likely cause a seahorse to have bacterial issues.  So it's very important to follow these guidelines regarding frozen foods:
                      </p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>
                            Check the color of frozen food - When you purchase frozen mysis, pay attention to the color.
                            Frozen mysis should be white, not brown
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Check the expiration date on frozen food - obviously don't buy outdated foods, but also check if the food looks "thawed and refrozen".  If
                            there are any bubbles in the packaging or obvious signs (like the food is all pushed to one area of the container and refrozen), don't buy it.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Remove uneaten food within 10 minutes - if there is any food remaining in the tank after ten minutes, siphon it out!  Your seahorse might eat it
                            later, but the bacteria that has grown upon it might make him/her sick.
                          </li>
                        </ol>

                        As for the types of food to feed seahorses, we recommend the following:
                      </p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>
                            Frozen Mysis - Contain everything that a seahorse needs to stay healthy!  Just be sure to follow the guidelines above to ensure that you provide
                            your seahorses quality frozen mysis.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Gut Loaded Artemia - As a treat for your seahorses, you can buy live artemia (brine shrimp) and gut load them with probiotics and
                            other suppliments that will provide seahorses with "boost" to their system! We will cover this in more detail in a future article.

                        Your maintenance routine will depend largely on your set up.  If you have a large tank with a lot of biological and mechanical filtration, your maintenance
                        routine will differ.  Testing is the best way to determine how your filtration is working and what you need to change.  They typical routine includes weekly
                        testing to determine your parameter levels, followed by a 20% water change.  If your tests conclude that your parameters are rising higher each week, you might
                        need to do a higher percentage of water change, or add more biological/mechanical filtration.  The bigger the tank (with more water volume), the less likely you'll
                        see problems creep up.

                        As mentioned in the <a href="#feeding">Feeding section</a>, a great way to keep your seahorse tank running smoothly is to remove any uneaten food. Seahorses WILL
                        eat leftovers an hour later, that are already covered in bad bacteria.  On that happy note, we will see you in the next article!
