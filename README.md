# cs50-web
A cs50 project using html, css, and js to create a simple homepage website.  As I am working on an actual website for seahorse keepers, a smaller version seemed like a win-win.
Suggestions are welcome!
The assignment instructions included creating a responsive website using:

<ul>
<li>bootstrap</li>
<li>html</li>
<li>css</li>
<li>javascript</li>
</ul>

to create:

<ul>
<li>4 pages</li>
<li>new css aside from bootstrap</li>
<li>at least one javascript function</li>
</ul>

My project includes:

<ul>
<li>a hero landing page</li>
<li>3 additional responsive pages</li>
<li>2 additional articles with sidebar</li>
<li>elimiation of sidebar on smaller screens</li>
<li>dynamic header/footer</li>
<li>fake email collection that provides response specific to user</li>
</ul>

Thanks for viewing my project!
